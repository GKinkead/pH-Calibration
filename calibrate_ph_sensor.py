"""MicroPython calibration script for the Gravity Analog pH Sensor (V2).

Run this file from Thonny while connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The script
will walk you through collecting voltage readings from two or three reference
buffer solutions and will compute linear calibration parameters for later use.
The computed parameters are saved to ``ph_calibration.json`` on the board so
that measurement scripts can use them directly.
